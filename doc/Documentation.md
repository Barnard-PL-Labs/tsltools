# Documentation

This is a test documentation to show how such a documentation could look like.
Note that the documentation is intended to be cross-linked (e.g Core Generation
module links core generation algorithm)

To get an overview over the different modules see (./Modules.md). Aside from 
that the following other documents are available:

* [Core Generation](./CoreGeneration.md) describe the algorithm to generate 
  minimal unrealizability cores and minimal realizable assumption cores.
* TSL splitting
