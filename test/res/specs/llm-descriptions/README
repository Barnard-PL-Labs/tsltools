This directory contains a folder for every example LLM synthesis generation problem.

1. `[Name].Prompt.txt` represents the human-readable prompt to feed into the LLM to generate the spec
2. `[Name].Spec.tsl` is the TSL spec
3. `[Name].Synth.js` is the program generated by the TSL spec - this is NOT written by a human, only by the TSL generator or LLM
4. `[Name].Impl.js` - the implementation of functions referenced by the TSL spec.

For (4), we are trying to get the LLM to generate the implementation, and compare it to if the LLM generated everything from the start without TSL.
